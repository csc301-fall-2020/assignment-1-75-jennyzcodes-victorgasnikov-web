In this project, I have borrowed design ideas from a public bootstrap snipped available at https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/y22W

This HTML snipped code was modified to adjust to the needs of the project. The referenced code was only an HTML snipped, which, paired with a BootStrap import was used purely for aesthetic purposes. No javascript or other code responsible for app functionality was used. All scripts and app logic in the submitted files, including UI functionality, was produced by me.

The attached report is for the entire technology stack used in this project, including web and mobile. The same copy is attached in the -mobile repository.
