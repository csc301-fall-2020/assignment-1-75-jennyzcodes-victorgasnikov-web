In this project, I have borrowed design ideas from a public bootstrap snipped available at https://bootsnipp.com/snippets/y22W

This HTML snipped code was modified to adjust to the needs of the project. The referenced code was only an HTML snipped, which was used purely for aesthetic purposes. No javascript or other code responsible for app functionality was used. All scripts and app logic in the files submitted files was produced by me.
